<h1>The Django source code repository<a class="headerlink" href="#the-django-source-code-repository" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h1>
<p>When deploying a Django application into a real production environment, you
will almost always want to use <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/download/">an official packaged release of Django</a>.</p>
<p>However, if you’d like to try out in-development code from an upcoming release
or contribute to the development of Django, you’ll need to obtain a clone of
Django’s source code repository.</p>
<p>This document covers the way the code repository is laid out and how to work
with and find things in it.</p>
<div class="section" id="high-level-overview">
<h2>High-level overview<a class="headerlink" href="#high-level-overview" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Django source code repository uses <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> to track changes to the code
over time, so you’ll need a copy of the Git client (a program called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></code>)
on your computer, and you’ll want to familiarize yourself with the basics of
how Git works.</p>
<p>Git’s website offers downloads for various operating systems. The site also
contains vast amounts of <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/documentation">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The Django Git repository is located online at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django">github.com/django/django</a>. It contains the full source code for all
Django releases, which you can browse online.</p>
<p>The Git repository includes several <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/branches">branches</a>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> contains the main in-development code which will become
the next packaged release of Django. This is where most development
activity is focused.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stable/A.B.x</span></code> are the branches where release preparation work happens.
They are also used for bugfix and security releases which occur as necessary
after the initial release of a feature version.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">soc20XX/&lt;project&gt;</span></code> branches were used by students who worked on Django
during the 2009 and 2010 Google Summer of Code programs.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">attic/&lt;project&gt;</span></code> branches were used to develop major or experimental new
features without affecting the rest of Django’s code.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Git repository also contains <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/tags">tags</a>. These are the exact revisions from
which packaged Django releases were produced, since version 1.0.</p>
<p>The source code for the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Djangoproject.com</a>
website can be found at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com">github.com/django/djangoproject.com</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-master-branch">
<h2>The master branch<a class="headerlink" href="#the-master-branch" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you’d like to try out the in-development code for the next release of
Django, or if you’d like to contribute to Django by fixing bugs or developing
new features, you’ll want to get the code from the master branch.</p>
<p>Note that this will get <em>all</em> of Django: in addition to the top-level
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django</span></code> module containing Python code, you’ll also get a copy of Django’s
documentation, test suite, packaging scripts and other miscellaneous bits.
Django’s code will be present in your clone as a directory named
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django</span></code>.</p>
<p>To try out the in-development code with your own applications, simply place
the directory containing your clone on your Python import path. Then
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">import</span></code> statements which look for Django will find the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django</span></code> module
within your clone.</p>
<p>If you’re going to be working on Django’s code (say, to fix a bug or
develop a new feature), you can probably stop reading here and move
over to <a class="reference internal" href="contributing/index.html"><span class="doc">the documentation for contributing to Django</span></a>, which covers things like the preferred
coding style and how to generate and submit a patch.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-branches">
<h2>Other branches<a class="headerlink" href="#other-branches" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h2>
<p>Django uses branches to prepare for releases of Django.</p>
<p>In the past when Django was hosted on Subversion, branches were also used for
feature development. Now Django is hosted on Git and feature development is
done on contributor’s forks, but the Subversion feature branches remain in Git
for historical reference.</p>
<div class="section" id="stable-branches">
<h3>Stable branches<a class="headerlink" href="#stable-branches" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h3>
<p>These branches can be found in the repository as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stable/A.B.x</span></code>
branches and will be created right after the first alpha is tagged.</p>
<p>For example, immediately after <em>Django 1.5 alpha 1</em> was tagged, the branch
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stable/1.5.x</span></code> was created and all further work on preparing the code for the
final 1.5 release was done there.</p>
<p>These branches also provide limited bugfix support for the most recent released
version of Django and security support for the two most recently-released
versions of Django.</p>
<p>For example, after the release of Django 1.5, the branch <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stable/1.5.x</span></code>
receives only fixes for security and critical stability bugs, which are
eventually released as Django 1.5.1 and so on, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stable/1.4.x</span></code> receives only
security fixes, and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stable/1.3.x</span></code> no longer receives any updates.</p>
<div class="admonition-historical-information admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Historical information</p>
<p>This policy for handling <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stable/A.B.x</span></code> branches was adopted starting
with the Django 1.5 release cycle.</p>
<p>Previously, these branches weren’t created until right after the releases
and the stabilization work occurred on the main repository branch. Thus,
no new features development work for the next release of Django could be
committed until the final release happened.</p>
<p class="last">For example, shortly after the release of Django 1.3 the branch
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stable/1.3.x</span></code> was created. Official support for that release has expired,
and so it no longer receives direct maintenance from the Django project.
However, that and all other similarly named branches continue to exist and
interested community members have occasionally used them to provide
unofficial support for old Django releases.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="feature-development-branches">
<h3>Feature-development branches<a class="headerlink" href="#feature-development-branches" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h3>
<div class="admonition-historical-information admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Historical information</p>
<p>Since Django moved to Git in 2012, anyone can clone the repository and
create their own branches, alleviating the need for official branches in
the source code repository.</p>
<p class="last">The following section is mostly useful if you’re exploring the repository’s
history, for example if you’re trying to understand how some features were
designed.</p>
</div>
<p>Feature-development branches tend by their nature to be temporary. Some
produce successful features which are merged back into Django’s master to
become part of an official release, but others do not; in either case there
comes a time when the branch is no longer being actively worked on by any
developer. At this point the branch is considered closed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Django used to be maintained with the Subversion revision
control system, that has no standard way of indicating this. As a workaround,
branches of Django which are closed and no longer maintained were moved into
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">attic</span></code>.</p>
<p>For reference, the following are branches whose code eventually became
part of Django itself, and so are no longer separately maintained:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">boulder-oracle-sprint</span></code>: Added support for Oracle databases to
Django’s object-relational mapper. This has been part of Django
since the 1.0 release.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gis</span></code>: Added support for geographic/spatial queries to Django’s
object-relational mapper. This has been part of Django since the 1.0
release, as the bundled application <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django.contrib.gis</span></code>.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">i18n</span></code>: Added <a class="reference internal" href="../topics/i18n/index.html"><span class="doc">internationalization support</span></a> to
Django. This has been part of Django since the 0.90 release.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">magic-removal</span></code>: A major refactoring of both the internals and
public APIs of Django’s object-relational mapper. This has been part
of Django since the 0.95 release.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">multi-auth</span></code>: A refactoring of <a class="reference internal" href="../topics/auth/index.html"><span class="doc">Django’s bundled
authentication framework</span></a> which added support for
<a class="reference internal" href="../topics/auth/customizing.html#authentication-backends"><span class="std std-ref">authentication backends</span></a>. This has
been part of Django since the 0.95 release.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">new-admin</span></code>: A refactoring of <a class="reference internal" href="../ref/contrib/admin/index.html"><span class="doc">Django’s bundled
administrative application</span></a>. This became part of
Django as of the 0.91 release, but was superseded by another
refactoring (see next listing) prior to the Django 1.0 release.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">newforms-admin</span></code>: The second refactoring of Django’s bundled
administrative application. This became part of Django as of the 1.0
release, and is the basis of the current incarnation of
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django.contrib.admin</span></code>.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">queryset-refactor</span></code>: A refactoring of the internals of Django’s
object-relational mapper. This became part of Django as of the 1.0
release.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unicode</span></code>: A refactoring of Django’s internals to consistently use
Unicode-based strings in most places within Django and Django
applications. This became part of Django as of the 1.0 release.</li>
</ul>
<p>When Django moved from SVN to Git, the information about branch merges wasn’t
preserved in the source code repository. This means that the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> branch
of Django doesn’t contain merge commits for the above branches.</p>
<p>However, this information is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ramiro/django-git-grafts">available as a grafts file</a>. You can restore it
by putting the following lines in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.git/info/grafts</span></code> in your local clone:</p>
